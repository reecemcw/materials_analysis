The plant will make products such as aerospace and military-grade magnets, the company said.In October, the company said it would raise $50 million through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal with an institutional investor to help develop its Tanbreez rare earth deposit in Greenland.EuropeNorth AmericaReutersRomanian stocksUS stocks© Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.
